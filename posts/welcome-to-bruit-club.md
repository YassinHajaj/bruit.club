# 👋 Welcome to BRUIT.club

We're live!

**BRUIT** — short for _BRUssels IT_ — is a community space for coders, creatives, and curious minds in Brussels.

Whether you're into **software development**, **AI**, **digital culture**, or just love building cool things with tech, you've found the right place.

## 💡 What is BRUIT.club?

A playground. A blog. A collective.  
A noisy place for bright ideas.  
Expect:

- 🔧 Tools and tips for devs
- 🧠 Thoughts on technology and society

- 💬 Events, meetups, and projects from Brussels & beyond

## 🎯 Why this blog?

To **share**, to **connect**, and to **document**.  
This blog is our notebook — raw, opinionated, and evolving.  
Sometimes polished, sometimes chaotic — just like BRUIT itself.
